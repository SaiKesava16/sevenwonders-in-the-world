<h2>About:</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">
    The Great Wall of China is one of the most iconic structures in human history, symbolizing both ancient engineering brilliance and China’s rich heritage. This remarkable wall stretches over 13,000 miles across northern China, winding through mountains, deserts, and plains, and was built over several dynasties to protect against invasions from northern tribes, including the Mongols. Construction began as early as the 7th century BCE during the Zhou Dynasty, but the wall we recognize today was largely built by the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 CE), who used advanced materials and techniques to create a more fortified barrier.<br/>
    <br/>Built primarily from earth, wood, bricks, and stone, the wall’s design is impressive, with watchtowers, garrison stations, and signaling platforms along its length to allow for communication and defense. It was not a single, continuous wall but rather a series of walls and fortifications that were connected over time. The Great Wall’s function extended beyond defense; it also helped control trade routes like the Silk Road, regulate immigration, and enforce taxes.<br/>
    <br/>Today, the Great Wall of China is a UNESCO World Heritage site and a symbol of Chinese resilience and ingenuity. Despite portions of the wall falling into disrepair over centuries, several sections, especially near Beijing, have been restored and are open to tourists. Millions of visitors each year marvel at its scale and the stunning landscapes it traverses. It’s a reminder of the lengths civilizations have gone to protect their people, culture, and legacy, and it remains one of the most remarkable architectural achievements in the world.</p>
