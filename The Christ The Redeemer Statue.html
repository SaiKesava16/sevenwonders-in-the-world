<h2>About:</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">The Christ the Redeemer statue (Cristo Redentor) is a monumental statue of Jesus Christ located atop the Corcovado Mountain in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Standing at 30 meters (98 feet) tall, with an additional 8 meters (26 feet) pedestal, it is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and a global symbol of Christianity and Brazilian culture. The statue was designed by Brazilian architect Heitor da Silva Costa and sculpted by French artist Paul Landowski, with construction taking place between 1922 and 1931.<br/>

    The statue is made of reinforced concrete and covered with thousands of triangular soapstone tiles, giving it a striking appearance that reflects light beautifully. It depicts Christ with open arms, symbolizing peace and welcoming all visitors to Rio de Janeiro. The choice of location on Corcovado Mountain provides a panoramic view of the city, the beaches, and the surrounding mountains, making it a breathtaking sight from both near and afar.<br/>
    Christ the Redeemer was inaugurated on October 12, 1931, and has since become an iconic symbol of Rio de Janeiro, attracting millions of tourists each year. The statue underwent a significant restoration project in 2010, which included cleaning, repairing the stone, and reinforcing the structure to withstand the elements.<br/>
    In 2007, the statue was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, further cementing its status as an important cultural and historical monument. It is often associated with various events and celebrations, including the annual New Yearâ€™s Eve festivities in Rio, where fireworks illuminate the statue, and the 2016 Olympic Games, during which it served as a symbol of welcome and hospitality.
    Christ the Redeemer represents not only religious faith but also the spirit of the Brazilian people, embodying the themes of love, compassion, and hope. Its majestic presence on the Rio skyline continues to inspire awe and reverence among both locals and visitors from around the world.</p>
