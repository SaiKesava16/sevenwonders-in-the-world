<h2>About:</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">The Pyramids of Giza, located on the Giza Plateau near Cairo, Egypt, are among the most iconic and enduring symbols of ancient civilization. Constructed during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, around 2580 to 2560 BCE, they serve as monumental tombs for the Pharaohs Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, also known as the Pyramid of Cheops, is the largest and oldest of the three, originally standing at about 146.6 meters (481 feet) and comprising an estimated 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite, with each block weighing between 2.5 to 15 tons.<br/>
The construction techniques used to build the pyramids remain a topic of scholarly debate, with various theories proposing the use of ramps, levers, and a skilled workforce of laborers, rather than slaves as traditionally thought. The pyramids were originally covered in casing stones made of highly polished Tura limestone, which reflected sunlight and made them shine brilliantly. Over the centuries, many of these casing stones have been removed, revealing the rough inner core.<br/>
Adjacent to the Great Pyramid is the Pyramid of Khafre, which appears taller due to its elevated location and retains some of its original casing at the apex. The smallest of the three, the Pyramid of Menkaure, measures about 65 meters (213 feet) and is constructed of granite. The Giza complex also includes the Great Sphinx, a monumental statue with the body of a lion and the head of a pharaoh, believed to represent Khafre and serving as a guardian of the necropolis.</p>
