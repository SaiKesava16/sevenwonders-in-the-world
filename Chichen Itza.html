<h2>About:</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">Chichen Itza is one of the most renowned archaeological sites of the Maya civilization, located in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Established around the 7th century AD and reaching its peak between the 10th and 12th centuries, Chichen Itza served as a major economic, political, and cultural center for the Maya. The site is famous for its impressive architecture, including the iconic pyramid known as El Castillo (the Castle) or Temple of Kukulcán, dedicated to the feathered serpent deity, Kukulcán.<br/>

    El Castillo stands at approximately 24 meters (79 feet) tall and features a stepped design with a total of 365 steps—one for each day of the year. During the spring and autumn equinoxes, a fascinating optical illusion occurs: as the sun sets, shadows create the appearance of a serpent slithering down the pyramid's stairs, symbolizing Kukulcán's descent to Earth. This phenomenon showcases the Maya's advanced understanding of astronomy and their ability to integrate it into their architectural designs.<br/>
    
    In addition to El Castillo, Chichen Itza is home to numerous other significant structures, including the Great Ball Court, the Temple of the Warriors, and the Observatory, known as El Caracol. The Great Ball Court, the largest of its kind in Mesoamerica, reflects the cultural importance of the Mesoamerican ball game, which held religious and social significance.<br/>
    
    Chichen Itza was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988 and is considered one of the New Seven Wonders of the World as of 2007. The site attracts millions of visitors each year, who come to explore its rich history and stunning ruins. The blend of Mayan and Toltec influences in the architecture at Chichen Itza reflects the site's role as a melting pot of cultures and its importance in the region's history.</p>
