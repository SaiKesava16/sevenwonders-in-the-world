<h2>About:</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px;">The Taj Mahal, located in Agra, India, is an iconic monument and one of the most celebrated symbols of love in the world. Built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, this majestic mausoleum combines elements of Islamic, Persian, and Indian architectural styles, making it a masterpiece of Mughal architecture. Constructed between 1632 and 1653, the Taj Mahal is made primarily of white marble that shimmers in different colors depending on the time of day—pinkish at dawn, milky white under sunlight, and golden under moonlight.<br/>The complex features meticulously symmetrical gardens in a Charbagh layout, symbolizing the Islamic vision of paradise, and includes a main mausoleum flanked by a mosque and a guesthouse. Its central dome, reaching 73 meters, is surrounded by four minarets slightly tilted outward for earthquake protection, while the walls are adorned with intricate inlay work of semi-precious stones and elegant calligraphy. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 and celebrated as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal attracts millions of visitors annually and stands as a timeless testament to the artistic and cultural heritage of India.<br/>
    With its immense historical, cultural, and architectural significance, the Taj Mahal stands as one of the world’s most admired structures, attracting millions of tourists every year. It serves as a testament to the Mughal era’s legacy and India’s rich history, and continues to inspire awe with its unparalleled beauty and meticulous craftsmanship.Historically, the Taj Mahal has witnessed the highs and lows of India’s journey through the centuries. During British colonial rule, the gardens were redesigned to mimic the English style, deviating from the original Mughal layout. It also faced damage during periods of conflict and environmental threats, prompting conservation efforts to preserve its grandeur. Today, air pollution from the surrounding area remains a concern, as it threatens to discolor the marble. The Indian government has implemented strict measures to control pollution in the vicinity, including restricting vehicles near the site and regulating industrial activity.</p>
